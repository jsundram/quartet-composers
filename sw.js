// Service worker: offline shell + cache-busting.
//
// THE ONE RULE: bump V whenever you change a precached SHELL file. A new V is what refreshes the
// shell — forget the bump and your fix ships to the repo but never to anyone's installed
// home-screen copy (iOS caches the SW aggressively). scripts/sw-lint.py guards this, and app.js
// surfaces a "tap to update" tag so a stuck phone is fixable in one tap.
//
// Strategy, by what the file IS rather than where it lives:
//   HTML/JS + navigations → CACHE-FIRST once installed: paint from the precache with NO network on
//     the critical path, so a load is instant and identical on a fast link, a slow one, or none.
//     Freshness is handled OFF the critical path, because the shell is owned per-generation
//     (cachePut won't overwrite it) and a new deploy MUST bump V anyway (THE ONE RULE): a V bump
//     installs the new shell and lights app.js's update tag. A background revalidate here would
//     just be discarded, so there isn't one. Only an uncached or unbootable request falls through
//     to a bounded network-first fetch, which ALWAYS ends at a real Response. NB this rests on
//     every live url being a SHELL file (it is as shipped): a future NON-shell .html/.js would be
//     served cache-first with no revalidation until a V bump collects the old generation — add
//     such a file to SHELL (and bump V), don't lean on opportunistic caching to refresh it.
//   JSON → paint from cache now. PRECACHED json is owned by the install, so a V bump is what
//     refreshes it; any other same-origin json is stale-while-revalidate
//   images and everything else → cache-first for speed; a V bump is what refreshes them
//   cross-origin data (your APIs) → straight through, never cached here
//
// The precache is PER-FILE — deliberately never a bare cache.addAll(). That buys self-healing and
// costs a third cache state, PARTIAL, which this whole file then has to reason about. Three
// questions addAll answered implicitly become live, and every function below answers one of them:
//   1. is this version's cache COMPLETE?     → ensureShell() / topUpThenCollect()
//   2. which GENERATION answers a read?      → cacheLookup(), the directional collect
//   3. is a complete-looking cache BOOTABLE? → bootable() / offlineFallback()
// Get one wrong and the failure is a blank white screen offline, a lost offline copy, or a stale
// one that never updates. The seven review rounds behind this design: #7.

// It also only fetches what's MISSING, which makes it safe to call repeatedly — that's how an

//
// Why the split: the collect waits for a complete precache, so a SHELL entry that can never be
// fetched — a renamed file, a typo'd path — would otherwise keep it waiting FOREVER. Both cache
// generations then live on the device permanently, with the old one still answering (via
// cacheLookup's whole-store fallback) for anything absent from the new one. A 404 is a bug in the
// SHELL list that no amount of retrying repairs, so it must not hold the collect hostage;
// everything genuinely retryable still does. scripts/sw-lint.py catches the repo-side version of
// this at commit time, before it can ship — this path is damage control, not the guard.
//
// Deliberately CONSERVATIVE about what counts as permanent, because guessing wrong trades a
// working offline copy for an empty one. A REDIRECT is transient — a captive portal redirects
// everything, and that is a mobile-normal state, not a broken shell list. 5xx is transient (a
// mid-deploy blip). 408/429 are transient by definition. A 206 is transient — a partial means the

// is not on the server" — 4xx other than those — is permanent.

  // offline catch never fired, respondWith() stayed pending, and WebKit painted a blank screen —
  // "internet, but too slow to answer." Network-first also fetched the shell on every load only
  // to DISCARD it: cachePut() refuses to overwrite SHELL urls, and every live url is a SHELL
  // file. So the latency bought no freshness the update tag doesn't already deliver.
  //
  // Cache-first fixes both: paint straight from the precache, no network on the critical path,
  // instant whether the link is fast, slow, or gone. Freshness is off this path (a V bump
  // installs the new shell and lights the tag; see the strategy note up top). The network is
  // touched only when the cache CAN'T answer — a first run, or an evicted/partial shell — and
  // that fetch is bounded so even it can't hang on lie-fi.
  //
  // One accepted consequence of serving the shell from cache rather than the network: during a
  // partial install (V bumped, top-up not yet complete), cacheLookup()'s whole-store fallback can
  // pair a new-generation document with an old-generation subresource — index.html@vN with
  // app.js@vN-1 — until the collect completes. bootable() gates every boot-critical dep
  // (BOOT, above), so a genuinely broken pairing shows the offline page instead.

//     the one situation it's for. (Same reasoning as index.html's pre-paint theme stamp.)
//   - It HARDCODES the placeholder palette (#f5f5f5 / #1a1a1a / #2196f3) and system-ui — a
//     fallback page that depends on a cached font defeats itself. When rebranding, this is an
//     instance of the palette row in CLAUDE.md §Workflow step 2's replacement table.
