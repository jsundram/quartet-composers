"""Commit-time checks for sw.js's precache contract.

sw.js precaches the app SHELL. Five mistakes are cheap to catch here and expensive at runtime:

1. A staged SHELL file with an unchanged V. An edit to a precached file only reaches installed
   clients when V changes — forget the bump and the fix ships to the repo but never to anyone's
   home-screen copy. The single most common PWA deploy bug.
2. A SHELL entry that doesn't exist on disk. It can never be fetched, so it permanently wedges
   the old-generation collect: both cache generations pile up on every device, with the stale one
   still answering via the whole-store fallback. (#7)
3. A cross-origin SHELL entry. The fetch handler passes other origins straight through, so the
   entry would be cached but never served — vendor the file locally instead.
4. A V without a numeric tail. The tail orders generations for sw.js's collect and app.js's
   checkVer() ranking; a non-numeric V makes collection silently stop, no error, no symptom,
   until caches pile up. Rename the stem freely — keep the digits.
5. app.js's VER_PREFIX not matching V's stem. checkVer() ranks installed caches by that prefix,
   so a renamed stem on one side only makes the version tag go blank (no cache matches) or read
   a sibling app's caches — silently, since nothing throws. The stems must agree. (#7)

The pre-commit hook runs it warn-only; run it in CI with a real exit code. By hand:
